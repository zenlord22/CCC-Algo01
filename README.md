# Code
Coding is in the C# language

## Program
1.	Retrieves the first element of the array (O(1) - Constant Time).
2.	Calculates the sum of all elements in the array (O(n) - Linear Time).
3.	Prints all possible pairs of elements in the array (O(n^2) - Quadratic Time).

## How to Use
1.	Input: The program prompts the user to enter the elements of the array separated by spaces.
2.	Output: The program displays the entered array, the first element, the sum of the array, and all possible pairs of elements.

## Complexity Analysis
•	GetFirstElement: This function runs in constant time, O(1), as it only retrieves the first element of the array.
•	SumArray: This function runs in linear time, O(n), as it iterates through the entire array to calculate the sum.
•	PrintAllPairs: This function runs in quadratic time, O(n^2), as it prints all possible pairs of elements in the array.

## Requirements
•	.NET SDK
•	Visual Studio or any C# compatible IDE

## Running the Program
1.	Open the project in Visual Studio.
2.	Build the solution.
3.	Run the program.
4.	Follow the prompt to enter the array elements separated by spaces.
